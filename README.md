## What is Terraform? 

Terraform is Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It is cloud agnostic - meaning it can deploy infrastructure as code to different cloud providers.

## Terraform Tips 

• Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Configuring resources in order to deploy it to the cloud and then iterate. Iterating means implementing variables or turning code into a terraform module. 

• Dry Software: Dry means "Dont Repeat Yourself". In terrraform, there are modules which can be used as templates. Often, the best terraform code will be the code that isn't constantly repeated. Using terraform modules and making terraform as dry as posible is the ultimate goal.
